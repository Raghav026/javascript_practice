var a = {a: 1};
var b = {a: 1};
console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
var c = a;
console.log(a == c);
console.log(a === c);

since objects are referenced types they are stored in address in memory therefor first 2 console will evaluate
to false and in line 5 we have coping address of a to c therefore next console will be true
