let a;
console.log(a === undefined); -> true
console.log(a === null); -> false
console.log(a * 2);-> NaN
console.log(`${a} is the value of a`); -> "undefined is the value of a"

we have not initialised the variable therfore the first console.log will be true and since undefined != null
next console.log will be false and if we do math operation with undefined we get NaN
